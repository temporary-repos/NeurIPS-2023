# NeurIPS-2023
Repository to hold the codebase for the NeurIPS-2023 submission titled "On Additive vs. Multiplicative Mechanisms for Learning to Adapt Neural Dynamic Functions"

### Checkpoints for Models
All models have an available trained checkpoint which can be loaded in and tested. Due to space constraints of Github, 
these have been offloaded to a Google Drive folder <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BYOpwUyq3HZC4yntG-xQSjfcbLDJg0MY?usp=share_link">here</a>, where each experiment type has a corresponding folder.
